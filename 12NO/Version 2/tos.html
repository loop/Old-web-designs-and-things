<p>Please read the Terms of Service before purchasing any of our  hosting packages. You MUST agree to our terms before applying for  webhosting from 12NO.COM. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.) Account Setup 12NO.COM </strong></p>

<p>For  shared hosting we will setup instantly your account after we have  received payment. Status of your order will be pending until we and/or  our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) incase of fraud. It  is your responsibility to provide us with an email address, which is  not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under, and to provide us correct  phone number, because every order will be checked by our Anti-Fraud  Phone Verification System. If you worry for your privacy, please read  our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. <br />
    <br />
  For reseller hosting it will take minimum of 6 hours for the account to  be set up as we have to check the payment properly for this kind of  hosting. But don't worry it will be no more than 6 hours, if it is than  we will give you money back and you will still get the reseller.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.) Content </strong></p>
<p>All  services provided by 12NO.COM may only be used for lawful purposes.  This includes, but not limited to; phishing material, material we judge  to be threatening or obscene.
